# Compact Bilinear Pooling
The compact bilinear pooling caffe and matconvnet implementation.

See each folder for their readmes.

A torch version of the compact bilinear layer is available at: https://github.com/jnhwkim/cbp in the context of visual question answering, by Jin-Hwa Kim.

Also, tensorflow implementations have been provided by Ronghang Hu (https://github.com/ronghanghu/tensorflow_compact_bilinear_pooling) and Hyojun Kim (https://github.com/therne/compact-bilinear-pooling-tf). Thanks for those re-implementations!
